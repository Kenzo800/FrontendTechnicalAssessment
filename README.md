# testing

The parts that I finished are the following:

1. The button to exit the onBoardingScreen which occurred after 5 second
      - using timer to count 5 second
      - during the counting, a prompting text will show in the top right
      - simple navigation button shown after 5 second
      
2. The walkthrough page that shown for the new user
      - using shared preferences to distinguish whether the user is new to here
      - using PageView to perform the scrolling
      
3. UI 
      - using adobeXD to flutter function to generate the UI 

## Limitation

This is my first flutter project.
I am not familiar with the UI building of flutter.
The XD to flutter function provided by adobe is using Pinned which is fixed positioning.
The UI will not be consistent.
